    "Each unique site type per unique molecule is characterized by a numerical index ``siteid``, which (for consistency with C++) starts with ``0``. In the example above, the indices would go like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``0``: site type A on left molecule (multiplicity of 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "``1``: site type B on left molecule (multiplicity of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "``2``: site type C on left molecule (multiplicity of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "``3``: site type A on right molecule (multiplicity of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "``4``: site type B on right molecule (multiplicity of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a molecule, the numbering of sites is arbitrary, but the mapping cannot be changed once it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association can occur when a site can \"dock\" with another kind of site. In the most common kind of association used to model hydrogen bonding, there are two classes of sites, positive or negative (``e`` and ``H`` in Clapeyron.jl). teqp allows for great flexibility in defining the site types and how they are permitted to interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work of Langenbach and Enders () shows how to construct a counting matrix to make the successive substitution faster because not all sites are included in the summation, rather the sites within a molecule are clustered into groups, since all sites of a similar type will have the same association fractions. Thus a counting matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ can be defined, with entries $D_{IJ}$ for the pair of siteid ``I`` and ``J`` with the pseudocode\n",

    "in which the dictionary ``interaction_parameters`` defines which sites are allowed to interact with each other. The typical alcohol+water family would be modeled with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "interaction_parameters = {'e': ['H'], 'H': ['e']}\n",
    "```\n",
    "and to follow the system considered above, we would have:\n",

    "inv_mapping = {\n",

    "    1: (0, 'B'),\n",

    "}\n",
    "counts = [2, 1, 1, 1] # multiplicities for each siteid\n",
    "```\n",
    "The definition of the dictionary ``interaction_parameters`` would depend on how you want to allow the sites to associate. Sites that are not permitted to interact with each other are removed from the D matrix (are set to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "The successsive substitution step gives the estimated values with\n",
    "$$\n",
